My First Project

==Description==

This is the first project I am doing for the Odin Project and I hope that it goes well. I 
really do not want to be one of those people that quit once it gets too hard. After this project
I will do a reflection on how everything went.

Ok So now that I am done. It was very interesting to see how everything went. I was able to do everything asked of the project I just wish I could have done more but with my limited knowledge it was the most I could do. I look forward to diving deeper into this course.
